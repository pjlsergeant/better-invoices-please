# How to not screw up invoices/receipts in your SaaS app

## What you should do

* Send PDFs by email at each billing period, I don't want to have to login and guess where you hide them each time I'm logging them
* Allow me to specify a different email address from main for these to go to; I often want to use `finance@` or something like Receipt Bank to process them
* Allow me to specify a company name and address completely distinct from the billing details
* If I'm coming to your website to download the invoices, please don't play silly games with JavaScript popups when I click the download link -- I often need to download several and will be clicking to open in a new tab
* Use a sensible filename for the invoice, not your internal name, ideally: `YYYY-MM-DD YourCompany ref.pdf`
* Allow me to self-serve download the PDFs after I've cancelled

## Highlighted Offenders

* **LinkedIn** refuse to email receipts
